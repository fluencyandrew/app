# FluencyFrames – Three-Stage Lexical Precision System

## 1. System Objective

The system builds productive lexical precision through a controlled progression:

- **Stage 1 – Contrast Encoding**
- **Stage 2 – Override Retrieval**
- **Stage 3 – Automation Under Pressure**

Each lexical cluster moves from explicit discrimination to autonomous production.

## 2. Cluster Architecture

Each cluster contains:

- 1 Base Placeholder
- 2–6 Precision Variants
- 1 Pill per sense
- Stage-specific exercise logic
- Integration tracking (12 weighted score threshold)

## 3. Stage Definitions

### Stage 1 — Contrast Encoding

**Cognitive Goal**
- Encode full lexical form
- Encode syntactic rhythm
- Bind form to pill signature
- Establish contrast with placeholder

**Structural Rules**
- Exactly 2 answer options
- Both fully grammatical replaceable units
- No distractor
- Visible pill
- Floating lexical menu active
- No time pressure

**Example Pattern**

Cluster: CONTACT  
Variant: reach out to

Prompt:
> "I'd like to ______ regarding the earlier proposal."

Options:
- A) contact you
- B) reach out to you

Correct: B

### Stage 2 — Override Retrieval

**Cognitive Goal**
- Remove scaffolding
- Strengthen override reflex
- Isolate dominant pill variable

**Structural Rules**
- Exactly 3 options
- 1 distractor required
- Placeholder visible
- No pill
- No menu
- Moderate cognitive load

**Example Pattern**

Sentence:
> "I'll contact them again tomorrow."

Instruction:
> Keep or replace.

Options:
- A) contact them
- B) chase them up
- C) consult them

Correct: B

### Stage 3 — Automation

**Cognitive Goal**
- Stable retrieval under:
  - Time pressure
  - Hierarchical sensitivity
  - Interruption
  - Variable competition

**Structural Rules**
- No options
- Timed response
- Full phrase required
- Regex or exact match evaluation

**Example Prompt** (5s timer):
> "Two weeks silence from investor. Respond."

Expected:
> "I just wanted to chase up the proposal."

## 4. Pill Architecture

Each sense maps to exactly one Pill.

A Pill encodes:
- Role hierarchy
- Speaker goal
- Interlocutor goal
- Participant structure
- Emotional temperature
- Temporal condition
- Communicative effect
- Status signal

Pills represent situational activation signatures — not definitions.

## 5. Integration Model

**Weighted scoring:**

| Stage | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Stage 1 | +1 |
| Stage 2 | +2 |
| Stage 3 | +3 |

**Integration threshold:**
- `total_weighted_score ≥ 12`
- `≥ 2 Stage 3 successes`
- `≥ 2 Stage 2 overrides`

**States:**
- `ENCODING → CONSOLIDATING → INTEGRATED`

---

## 6. Design Principles

- Placeholder is never "wrong"
- Precision = strategic alignment
- Grammar is never referenced in feedback
- Feedback always explains:
  - Pill variable activated
  - Signal transmitted
  - Authority implications

**This is not a vocabulary app.**  
**It is a Precision Activation Tracking System.**
