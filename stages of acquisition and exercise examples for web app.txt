SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The system develops productive lexical precision across three controlled cognitive stages:

Noticing – Contrastive encoding + full-form embedding

Retrieval – Cue-triggered override of placeholder

Automation – Stable precision under pressure and interference

Core Cognitive Assumptions

The learner already possesses a fluent high-frequency placeholder (e.g., contact).

Precision variants exist receptively but are not stably retrievable.

Variants must be encoded as situationally indexed alternatives, not synonyms.

Production emerges from repeated cue-triggered override cycles.

Automation requires:

Time pressure

Hierarchical sensitivity

Interruption

Competing variables

Lexical Cluster Structure

Each cluster contains:

1 Base Placeholder

2–6 Precision Variants

Each variant linked to a structured Pill

Pill Architecture

Each Pill encodes:

Role hierarchy

Speaker goal

Interlocutor goal

Participant structure

Emotional temperature

Temporal condition

Communicative effect

Status signal transmitted

Pills are not definitions.
They are situational activation signatures.

STAGE 1 – NOTICING
(Contrastive Encoding + Full-Form Embedding)
Cognitive Objective

Encode full physical form of the variant.

Encode object placement / syntactic rhythm.

Bind form to a visible pill cue.

Establish contrast against fluent placeholder.

No retrieval pressure.

This stage is encoding, not performance.

Stage 1 Structural Rules

Exactly 2 answer options

Both answers are fully grammatical, complete units

If a variant requires object placement, the object must be embedded

Placeholder must appear in its complete replaceable form

The pill appears visibly inside the stimulus (boxed)

A floating lexical menu is available at all times (Stage 1 only)

The entire highlighted phrase is replaced — never a fragment

No distractors.
No semantic noise.
No time pressure.

Floating Pill–Sense Menu (Stage 1 Only)

Persistent UI element.

When the learner selects the correct answer:

Selected answer animates.

It visually merges with pill box.

Floating lexical field expands.

Variant is permanently indexed under its base placeholder.

Example lexical field:

CONTACT
→ contact (Neutral Initiation)
→ reach out to (Low-Pressure Relational Initiation)
→ chase someone up (Delayed Response Recovery)
→ consult (Expertise Validation)

Menu disappears in Stage 2 and Stage 3.

STAGE 1 – EXAMPLE 1
CONTACT Cluster
Base Placeholder

contact – Neutral Initiation

Variant

reach out to – Low-Pressure Relational Initiation

Role Frame

User Role: Project Manager
Goal: Reopen communication without urgency

Interlocutor: External Consultant
Goal: Maintain autonomy

Background:
Email sent last month. Non-urgent matter.

Visible Pill

🟦 Low-Pressure Relational Initiation

Prompt

You are drafting an email:

“I’d like to ______ regarding the earlier proposal.”

Answer Choices (Full Replacement Units)

A) contact you
B) reach out to you

Correct: B

Feedback Logic

If B →
Consultant: “Thanks for reaching out — happy to revisit this.”
Goal alignment: ✅
Status signal: Non-imposing

If A →
Consultant: “Understood. Is this time-sensitive?”
Goal alignment: ?
Status signal: Slight urgency projection

Stage 1 Explanation focuses only on:

Strategic signal transmitted

Pill variable activated

Why the alternative shifts tone

Never grammar.

STAGE 1 – EXAMPLE 2
Object Placement Encoding

Cluster: CONTACT
Variant: chase someone up – Delayed Response Recovery

Background

Two emails sent. No reply. Deadline tomorrow.

Visible Pill

🟦 Delayed Response Recovery

Prompt

You now need to ______.

Answer Choices

A) chase them up
B) contact them

Correct: A

Key Encoding Target:

Full phrasal unit

Object embedded

Rhythm: “chase THEM up”

Entire highlighted phrase replaced

This prevents fragment-level encoding.

STAGE 1 – Exercise Type 2
Constraint Embedding

Purpose: Encode structural constraints beyond surface collocation.

Focus:

Participant structure

Thematic roles

Power symmetry

Interaction directionality

Example – Participant Constraint

Base Placeholder: meet
Variant: come across

Constraint:

meet requires mutual participation

come across allows unilateral discovery

Prompt:

“Have you ever ______ this kind of cat?”

A) met
B) come across

Correct: B

Because the cat is not engaged in reciprocal interaction.

This encodes participant structure constraint.

Example – Hierarchical Softening

“Hello, I’m ______ to enquire about collaboration.”

A) contacting you
B) reaching out to you

Correct: B

Encodes:

Emotional temperature

Hierarchical sensitivity

Relational positioning

STAGE 2 – RETRIEVAL
(Cue-Triggered Override)

Now scaffolding disappears.

Cognitive Objective

Remove visible pill

Remove floating menu

Force recall through embedded cue

Introduce distractor

Strengthen override reflex

Stage 2 Structural Rules

3 answer options

1 unrelated distractor

Placeholder visible and must be actively overridden

No pill box

No lexical menu

Moderate cognitive load

STAGE 2 – EXAMPLE 1
Override With Embedded Cue

User Role: Operations Lead
Background: Two emails. No reply. Deadline imminent.

Sentence Displayed:

“I’ll contact them again tomorrow.”

Instruction:
Keep or replace the highlighted phrase.

Answer Choices (Full Units)

A) contact them
B) chase them up
C) consult them

Correct: B

Cue variables:

Delayed response

Urgency

Accountability pressure

Feedback

If B →
Finance: “Apologies — we’ll prioritise this.”
Goal: ✅

If A →
Finance: “Noted.”
Goal: ?

If C →
Finance: “That’s not the issue.”
Goal: ❌

Diagnostic explanation:
Which variable triggered correct override.

STAGE 2 – Constraint Retrieval

Director: “Are you confident in the modelling assumptions?”

You:
“I’ll ______ the data science team before finalising.”

A) contact
B) consult
C) reach out to

Correct: B

Cue:

Expertise validation

Authority acknowledgment

Non-neutral consultation requirement

Learner must recall variant without pill support.

STAGE 3 – AUTOMATION
(Stability Under Pressure)

No visible placeholder.
No lexical support.
No menu.
Timed response.
Dynamic dialogue.

Cognitive Objective

Ensure precision survives:

Time pressure

Hierarchical tension

Interruption

Competing pill variables

STAGE 3 – Example 1
Timed Production

Prompt (5 seconds):

Investor waiting. Two weeks silence. Respond.

Learner must produce:

“I just wanted to chase up the proposal we discussed.”

System Reaction

If precision used →
Investor: “Thanks — let’s review tomorrow.”
✅

If placeholder used →
Investor: “Yes?”
?

If wrong sense →
Investor: “That’s not the issue.”
❌

No multiple choice.
Full phrase must be generated.

STAGE 3 – Multi-Pill Competition

Scenario:

You require:

Technical clarification

Response after delay

Hierarchical sensitivity

Available lexical field (internally known to learner):
contact
consult
chase up
reach out to

Correct choice depends on:

Which variable dominates

Which signal is strategically prioritised

This forces:

Variable ranking

Executive-level decision control

Strategic communicative framing

Feedback Architecture (All Stages)

Every response triggers:

Interlocutor reaction

Goal alignment indicator (✅ / ? / ❌)

Diagnostic explanation including:

Which pill variable was activated

Which variable was ignored

What strategic signal was transmitted

Authority / status implications

Feedback never references grammar.

Only:

Communicative effect

Strategic positioning

Perceived authority

Structural Summary
Stage	Cognitive Focus	Options	Distractor	Pill Visible	Menu	Pressure
1	Contrast Encoding	2	No	Yes	Yes	None
2	Cue Override	3	1	No	No	Moderate
3	Automation	Open	Implicit	No	No	High
Core Design Principles (Refined)

Placeholder remains usable — never framed as “wrong.”

Precision always maps to scenario-linked variable.

Stage 1 encodes physical form + pill binding.

Stage 2 strengthens override reflex.

Stage 3 trains stability under stress.

Constraint Embedding replaces surface collocation testing.

All answer options are full replaceable units.

Role/interlocutor logic persists across stages.

Every lexical field broadens from the learner’s existing 5000-word base toward controlled precision expansion.
